# ROB-The-Robot
ROB is a robot simulator created in blender, the 3D modeling program. ROB can be set up in any scene, but our example is a simple maze that is navigated with square markers and facial recognition. The camera placed in ROB's head takes a snapshot of what ROB sees and sends it to a python program which then uses OpenCV code to determine the direction to walk. This information is sent back to the blender scene, which now has ROB moved one unit it target direction. Once ROB reaches the final destination a video is compiled from the images of ROBS vision, as well as another video from the top down. A series of text files is used to communicate between blender and python.
